    "# Steps for transformation.\n",
    "# First you determine what range of exponents you want to test out. So in our example we had a range from negative two to positive two. And that's a commonly used range. \n",
    "# Then you'd apply these transformations to each value in the feature you'd like to transform. \n",
    "# Then you'd use some criteria to determine which of the transformations yielded the best distribution. You can read about what different criteria you can use to determine the best distribution"
